While “no further action” is reasonable and consistent, the determination is not entirely mechanical, introducing minor ambiguity. Therefore, a 4/5 fairness score best captures the stewarding nuance."}

Non-driving precedents also show a pattern of “no further action” when insufficient grounds exist.\n\n[Fairness Score]\nScore: 5/5  \nJudgement: Perfectly Fair  \nExplanation: The stewards’ conclusion that no driver was predominantly at fault is consistent with the Magnussen precedent from the same session. Qualifying traffic often produces momentary misjudgments without constituting impeding or unsafe behavior. No advantage was gained, safety was not compromised, and the decision aligns squarely with how similar incidents are handled. Therefore, issuing no penalty is entirely fair and appropriate.\n"}
